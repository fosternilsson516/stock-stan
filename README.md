# Hello Fellow Stock Enthusiasts!

I recently got into the stock market and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information everywhere. Podcasts, emails, news articles... it felt like I was always missing out on something crucial. 

That's why I created this website. It's not a stock market oracle (yet!), but it aims to simplify things. I pull in data from various sources - news, social media, analyst reports, historical data - clean it up, and then let "Stock Stan" try to explain it all in plain language.
