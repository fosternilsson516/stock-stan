<p>NextEra Energy, a titan in the utility sector, is known for its high price tag, but there might be a hidden gem in the shadows.

<p>This article paints a grim picture for dollar store giants like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).  The headline says it all - is this the end of the dollar store dominance?  Concerns about consumer spending and underwhelming earnings could put a damper on these stocks.  Keep an eye on the value retailers ‚Äì things might get bumpy.</p>
